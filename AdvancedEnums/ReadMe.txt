You can combine enum members. To prevent ambiguities, members of a combinable enumrequire explicitly assigned values, typically in powers of two:Example :	[Flags]	enum BorderSides { None=0, Left=1, Right=2, Top=4, Bottom=8 }  or	enum BorderSides { None=0, Left=1, Right=1<<1, Top=1<<2, Bottom=1<<3 }	The operators that work with enums are:		= == != < > <= >= + - ^ & | ˜ += -= ++ -- sizeofThe bitwise, arithmetic, and comparison operators return the result of processing the underlying integral values.Addition is permitted between an enum and an integral type, but not between two enums.
